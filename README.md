# Memory Capsule

### Introduction
Have you ever thought of making a time capsule? This app allows your dream to come true! 
This app tracks your location, and you are able to capture a memory in a form of texts. The application knows when and where you took it.
The memory disappears when you move away from the location, but when you come back, it will pop up for you to see!
You can also see the memories of other users in your location. Ever wondered how others experienced your favourite attraction? Now think again!

### Features
-Tracks location.

-Can see information in two ways: a form of Google Maps and text-based menu

-Add your information, which will be stored outside of your device (remember to not share personal information!)
